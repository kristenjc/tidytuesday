# TidyTuesday
This repository contains my contributions to the #TidyTuesday challenge, a weekly social data proejct that allows me the opportunity to strengthen skills related to data exploration, analysis and visualization. 

The project was founded in 2018 by Thomas Mock and organized by the R4DS (R for Data Science) online learning community.
